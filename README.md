## SecQR: A Network-Based QR Code Security Tool Using Visual Watermarking and Image Steganography Techniques

<p align="justify">The increasing popularity of QR codes has led to their extensive use in various applications, including payment systems, event ticketing, and product tracking. However, the security of QR codes has become a major concern due to their susceptibility to malicious attacks. QR codes can be easily replicated and altered, leading to the potential risk of fraudulent activities. To address this issue, our proposed capstone, entitled "SecQR: Enhancing QR Code Security with Visual Watermarking and Image Steganography," aims to improve the security of QR codes by incorporating visual watermarking and image steganography techniques.</p
